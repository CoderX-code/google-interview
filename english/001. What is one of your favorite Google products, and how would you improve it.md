# What is one of your favorite Google products, and how would you improve it?
Of course Google wants to know that you know and appreciate their products, but they want more than a shower of affection here. Did you know that Google wants each employee to dedicate 20 percent of their time innovating? That's how serious Google is about keeping their company on the cutting edge of technology. 

Answer this question by doing a deep dive into one of their products, showing that you truly understand how it works and the value it brings to both the company and the world at large. Then, talk about what could make it even better and how that could be achieved. 

**Example:** I love the Google Nest Learning Thermostat. It seems so simple, but the way that it learns our preferences throughout the day to adjust the temperature in our house as needed is truly innovative. Not only does it lower the temperature when we're gone and bring it back up by the time we walk in the door after work, it will pay for itself in no time with what we save on the power bill. 

How could it be better? Make it compatible with more products, like the Apple Home Kit. You're losing potential buyers there.
